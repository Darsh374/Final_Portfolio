<h1>Course: HTML</h1>
<h2>Taught By: Professor Keith Williams</h2>
<h3>What I learned</h3>

<p>
    There is a lot to learn for HTML and since this was only an introductory course, we have touched the surface of
    unlimited possibilities</p>
<br>
<p>
    The major topics and skills Professor Williams emphasized were:
</p>

<ol>

    <li> How to properly collaborate using Github and Git</li>
    <li> How to link upto AFS</li>
    <li> Basic computer terminology and website formats</li>
</ol>
<h4>What is Git and Github?</h4>
<p>Git is version control system for tracking changes in a source code for software development. Github is a web-based
    hosting service for version control using GIT. It gives you distributed version control and source code management
    functionality of GIT.</p>
<h4>How to properly collaborate using Github and Git</h4>
<p>Now that we know what Git and Github are, how do we use this to help develop websites. Once you work in the corporate
    world many people will be working on one project. So to share each others work and changes, Git and Github are
    needed. To start you first create a repository on Github. After creating the repository, you can add however many
    collaborators to work on the project. All the collaborators will create their own branch to work on to prevent
    errors on the master branch. When changes are made, team members create commits. Once commits are made, you have to
    merge your own personal branch into your local master branch. Then you push all your stuff through Git. The purpose
    of doing this is that other members can then pull everything you pushed to Git and now the origin master has all the
    changes you made and whoever else made.</p>
